  * **Turn off Antivirus:** Your antivirus might falsely flag the aimbot. Whitelist the folder or temporarily disable it during use.
  * **Update Game Client:** Always ensure your Rust game client is fully updated before launching our aimbot.
  * **Run as Admin:** Launch `RustLoader.exe` as an administrator for proper functionality and injection.
  * **Whitelist Folder:** Add the aimbot's folder to your antivirus exceptions to prevent deletion or quarantine.
  * **Play Smart:** Avoid obvious aim-locking or impossible flick shots. Use the "smooth aim" feature to make your aiming look natural. Don't engage in blatant, rage-style cheating that will draw player reports.
  * **HWID Spoofing:** If you've been previously banned, leverage our built-in or recommended HWID spoofing features to help prevent hardware bans on new accounts.
